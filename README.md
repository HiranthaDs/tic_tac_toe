This program implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++, a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking the spaces in the grid, with the goal of creating a row, column, or diagonal of their marker (either 'X' or 'O'). The game includes input validation, a grid display, winner detection, and proper handling of ties.
